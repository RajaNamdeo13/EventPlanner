      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <p>
        EventPlanner is a modern event management platform built to simplify how
        events are created, discovered, and managed. From college fests and tech
        meetups to workshops and private gatherings, EventPlanner provides a single
        organized space for all types of events.
        <br /><br />
        We aim to remove the confusion of scattered messages, forms, and manual
        coordination by offering a smooth and reliable experience for both event
        organizers and participants. Organizers can manage event details
        effortlessly, while users can explore events and stay updated in real
        time.
        <br /><br />
        With a focus on simplicity, clarity, and efficiency, EventPlanner helps
        bring people together and makes event management smarter and more
        accessible for everyone.
